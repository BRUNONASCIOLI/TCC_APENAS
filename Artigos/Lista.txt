  - Service-Oriented Distributed Control Software Design for Process Automation Systems (Bom artigo, da p pegar coisa)

  - A Component-based design pattern for Improving Reusability of Automation Programs (+/-, é bom reler)

  - An Object-Oriented Approach to an Agile Manufacturing Control System Design (Bom em certas partes, mas ta mais p um                                                                                  manual)

  - Model-Driven design of Industrial Control Systems (N li tudo, mas fala mt sobre XML)   

  - An Object-Oriented Approach to an Agile Manufacturing Control System Design (Básico, mas bom)

  - Service-Oriented Architecture in Industrial Automation SystemsThe case of IEC 61499 A Review (Entendi NADA)
